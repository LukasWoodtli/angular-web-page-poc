Title: Software Development Priorities

There are a lot of topics that affect the quality and user experience of software. I try to collect some of the most important ones here:

1. Correctness: The program does what it needs to do. No failures, bugs errors.
2. Maintability: If the code is not maintainable you will sooner or later not be able to build a correct software.
3. Performance and Ressources: If the program needs to much memory or is too slow and not responsible the user won't like to use it.
4. Ease of use: The usability of the software needs to be intuitive.
